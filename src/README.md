# Source Code
In this folder, we store source codes for the anomaly detection, segmentation and motif discovery as well as the used window size selection procedures.

- `anomaly_detection` contains the code for the anomaly detection algorithms
- `motifs` contains the code for the motif discovery algorithms, in part taken from todo
- `segmentation` contains the code the segmentation algorithms, partially taken from
